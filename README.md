hi, I'm Sai Kuppa, a passionate self-taught full stack developer. my passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant scalable solutions. i take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

i am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. i learned a lot from the open-source community and i appreciate how collaboration and knowledge sharing happen through open-source.
